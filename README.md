Image classification for the breast cancer

● Download breast histopathology images dataset from kaggle and split them into training, validation and testing sets, and then separate them into negative (no cancer) and positive (have cancer) subfolders respectively.

● Create Resnet18 based on Keras as the CNN model and tune its parameters, then use the training datasets to train the model’s ability of detecting breast cancer in the histopathology images. 

●  Use the trained model to predict the results of test datasets, and get the accuracy higher than 86%.
